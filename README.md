# starter-go

A starter Go language project

## Introduction

Go is not a difficult language to learn, compared to other options. The syntaxis was specifically designed to _take things out_ so you have a minimal set of tools that prevent developers to overengineer programs. And it doesn't offer a ton out-of-the-box libraries you are required to wrap your code around.

But many of the things that makes a great Go program are beyond its syntaxis and libraries, and more on _how it is supposed to be used_.

I created this repo for my own sake to take notes on this recommendations, common best practices, important third party libraries, and starting codebase.

## Setting up your development environment

### Install Go

The official _Go_ website [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install) provides steps to install required Go binaries and files, for Linux, Mac or Windows.

It will also instruct you to add the Go binaries directory to your path.

Then you can verify the installation worked by running:

```bash
go version
```
